# Lasers
The user is able to enter 1 or 2 arguments, with the first being the configuration of the safe and the second being an optional command file. The configuration specifies the size of the safe, the locations of every pillar, and the number of outlets in each pillar. If a user does not enter a second argument, the base safe is displayed and the user is able to issue various commands. In order for the user to win every space must be covered with either a laser, a pillar or a beam from a laser. A laser is an object that creates 4-directional beams which stop at the end of the safe or until they hit a pillar. A laser must be charged with a pillar, meaning a laser can only be placed in the immediate vicinity of a pillar. A pillar is represented by a number (specifying the number of lasers it must have) or an X (indicating 0 or more lasers can be used here). The user wins when they use the verify command and the output confirms that the safe is fully verified.
